## @ C++
>
> C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language first released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. <br>
>
> * Multi-paradigm: procedural, imperative, functional, object-oriented, generic, modular. <br>
> * Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup (1985).

## @ Java
>
> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA). <br>
>
> * Multi-paradigm: generic, object-oriented (class-based), functional, imperative, reflective, concurrent. <br>
> * Designed by James Gosling (May 23, 1995).

## @ JavaScript
>
> JavaScript is a high level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. <br>
>
> * Multi-paradigm: event-driven, functional, imperative, procedural, object-oriented programming. <br>
> * Designed by Brendan Eich of Netscape. (Dec 4, 1995).

## @ Python
>
> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. <br>
>
> * Multi-paradigm: object-oriented, procedural (imperative), functional, structured, reflective. <br>
> * Designed by Guido van Rossum (20 Feb, 1991).

## @ TypeScript
>
> TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. <br>
>
> * Multi-paradigm: functional, generic, imperative, object-oriented. <br>
> * Designed & Developed by Microsoft (1 Oct 2012).
