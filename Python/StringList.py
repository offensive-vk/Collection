# the generate_string_list function iterates through each number in the input list (numbers). Depending on the specified conditions:

# If a number is divisible by both 2 and 4, it appends "I'm" to the result list.
# If a number is not divisible by any number but 1 or itself (a prime number), it appends "Prime" to the result list.
# If a number is divisible by 7, it appends "with" to the result list.
# If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it appends "Coding" to the result list.
# Otherwise, it appends the string representation of the number.
