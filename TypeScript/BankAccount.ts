/**

You are tasked with implementing a simple banking system. Create a TypeScript class BankAccount with the following features:

1. The class should have properties for accountNumber (string), accountHolder (string), and balance (number).

2. Implement a constructor that initializes the accountNumber and accountHolder. The balance should be initialized to 0.

3. Include methods deposit and withdraw to modify the balance.

4. Implement a method getBalance that returns the current balance.

Write a TypeScript program that creates an instance of BankAccount, performs some transactions, and prints the final balance.
